## Getting started with Android development
 
To get started you'll need to install Android Studio. You can get it along with instructions at the [Android developer site](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html). This will also download the Android SDK. Make sure that you have plenty of space. Over time installing different version of the Android SDK can fill up hard drive space quickly. If you don't have Java installed, make sure to [grab that](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) as well. JDK 7.x will do.
