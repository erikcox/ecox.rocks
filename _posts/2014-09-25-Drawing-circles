Make an app that draws circles of a random size, color, and position. It has to store circles info in an array and have a generate and clear button
Store circles in an ArrayList. Advanced method: use double buffering.

Working with graphics requires separate classes that have nothing to do with activity. Ex) DrawCircle class.
They should extend View.

{% highlight xml %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% include twitter_plug.html %}
